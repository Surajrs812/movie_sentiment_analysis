This project conducts sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using artificial neural network (ANN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). It preprocesses data, incorporates pre-trained GloVe word embeddings, and evaluates models' performance. The code enables predicting sentiments for unseen reviews. Users can reproduce the analysis in a Google Colab environment. The IMDb dataset, GloVe embeddings, and unseen reviews are required for execution.
